# Player a 2D Game
It is a 2D Game similar to mario and I used a GODOT Game Engine for creating this game. It's a simple and straight forward game 

## WORKING PROCESS

Before designing the story and challenges of the game it is necessary to determine a series of
game characteristics that may affect subsequent design decisions. These features include
gender, avatar control, platform, future users, narrative level, area of application and
interactivity. For example, the classification of things could be used to determine the video
game genre (e.g. action, adventure, fight, logic, simulation, sport, strategy, etc.).
We divide our design process into 4 parts: -
1. Ideation
2. Story and Narrative Development
3. Character and World Design
4. Player Testing and Prototyping
<br/>

## SYSTEM DESIGNING
System Designing become even more important to complete any game. For our project we
divide it into 5 key factors: -
1. About Platform
2. Programming Language
3. Actor Designing
4. Level Designing
5. User Interface
<br/>

## PROJECT RESULT & CONCLUSION
We learned a lot from this project about 2D game development. How things actually get done
and how sometime game making can be easy and how it can be so much difficult to build
games.
